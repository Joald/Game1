# README #

In this repository we keep our game. 
Version: pre-alpha development 

We work in Code::Blocks 13.12 with SFML 2.3 graphic library 

Please comment your code clearly, so that everyone would know what is the given piece of code responsible for.
If possible, please give descriptive names to variables, functions etc.


Last changes to the code were made in September 2015 when the project was abandoned after we were not able to find any graphic designers
that would create artwork for the game. Other contributors: Albert Bagieński, Mateusz Jońca, Aleksandra Lato.

Disclaimer: I now cringe at some parts of this code, though at not as many as in The Station.
