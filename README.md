In this repository we keep our game. 
Version: pre-alpha development I guess

We work in Code::Blocks 13.12 with SFML 2.3 graphic library up and running.

Please comment your code clearly, so that everyone would know what is the given piece of code responsible for.
If possible, please give descriptive names to variables, functions etc.
